### The approach taken:

The aim of this project is to understand more about Facebook Bot & NLP (Natural Language Processing).

At its current stage, AssistanceAlfred bot is able to ask and collect information on the user's credentials and email them to me to access if they are a suitable partnership to work together to develop great marketing or web projects.

#### Future Features, etc:

In near future, AssistanceAlfred should be further developed to take in clients' projects requests. Based on the client's need, it should be able to give an estimation of the cost of the project too.
